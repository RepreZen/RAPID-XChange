# RAPID-XChange
An API protocol for APIs described in RAPID-ML. RAPID-ML™ is a domain-driven API modeling language that enables data standardization across APIs.  RAPID-XChange™ is a native API protocol and message format for RAPID-ML APIs, translating RAPID-ML's data binding, object graph, and hypermedia semantics to a physical API contract.
